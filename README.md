## Mod races/factions

Exogenesis contains five different races each with there own lore, weapons, defense, and units.

`Credits to ƒêuvent for making both the lore of the factions and the two attack maps`

`Genesux`: In the Siravax System they lay in the sub-zero temperature planet called Siratla. There are other planets in the
system. Ruxt is comprised of Siratla Stone and Crystals, while Vantax is a Gas Planet. These three planets also have multiple moons surrounding them, along with their star called Siravax. The Genesux are comprised of cold energy and Siratla stone. They are a type of lithiods, and are quite strong. Their weapons and creations are made
out of a metal amalgam material formed from various metals and cold energy. Little is understood of their goal, but it seems like
nothing will stop them from achieving it.

`Solran`: These lithiod lifeforms are almost the opposites of the Genesux since they are extremely hot and have
capabilities out of this galaxy. They are found in the Alphandax System, a Binary System with two stars called Alphandax and Betanax.
The Solrans are comprised of molten rock and Volcanite, a material formed under the volcanos and lava oceans of their
planet Volceru. They get ores and crushed igneous rocks and they fuse them together to get the Volcanite that they
use to build their structures. Other planets in the Alphandax system include Furnius and Siten.

`Elecian`: They are found in the "Vanstarius System", they live on a gassy planet with 3/4 satelites, other planets in
this system also have satelites, the other planets are, Ravu, Duris. Mineus, although Duris and Mineus dont have
satelites we will still include them, the Eleciams are monsters at destruction and show no mercy, their technology are
very advanced and are un-matched in there will to fight, they are very strong and can pack quite a punch, wether you
have walls or not, the material that they use are unknown and are probably an alloy made out of titanium and some other
material.

`Terretux`: A lost civilization. In a galaxy long dead there lies a fallen empire, destroyed by a cataclysmic event.
Astronomers from Serpulo call it the "Forgotten empire". This species originated from the Erten system, with planets
surrounding it such as Xeantra and Celtus. They were powered by Dark Energy as well as an unknown form of energy. They used
their strong and strange materials to create weapons and technology not yet understood. What happened to this great
empire? We may never know, but artifacts have been recovered from the space around their galaxy.

`Quantra`: These peaceful, aquatic plant creatures are found in the Lumian System. They arent observed as much as the
others but have developed underwater and on islands and shores. They live in a radioactive biome of one of their oceans, and they
somehow acquired the materials to make several naval weapons.
